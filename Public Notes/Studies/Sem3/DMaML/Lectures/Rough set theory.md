### Rough set theory definition
Rough Set Theory (RST) proposes a new look for the knowledge and its representation. It is based on the assumption that the knowledge means the ability of distinguishing objects from each other. That means that we require a set of objects that we want to be distinguishable and a set of features that describe these objects.
# Information system
### Definition
Information system is an ordered pair $\mathbb{A} = (U, A)$, where: 
$U$ is non-empty and finite set of objects (universe), 
$A$ is non-empty and finite set of attributes, reflecting objectsâ€™ properties (features). 
Each attribute $a \in A$ is a function such that $a : U \rightarrow V_a$, where $V_a$ denotes the set of values of the attribute $a$, called a domain of $a$.

|$u_2$|$1$|$2$|$2.45$|red
|$u_3$|$0$|$3$|$1.56$|blue
