##### [[1.2 Conditional Probability, Independence and Bernoulli Trials]]
Dependent probability ->when events probability depends on another.
$P(A_i|A_0)$- event $A_i$ will occur only if event $A_0$ happened (A conditional probability of A is given A0 is defined by).A conditional probability of $A$ i given $A_0$ is defined by:
$$
P(A|A_0)=\frac{P(A\cap A_0)}{P(A_0)}
$$

Events $A_i$ and $A_0$ are called independent if there is no once effect on the other.
$$P(A_i|A_0)=P(A_i)$$
Consider rolling a [[EXAMPLE six-sided die]] twice. Let us determine the
probability space of this experiment.
