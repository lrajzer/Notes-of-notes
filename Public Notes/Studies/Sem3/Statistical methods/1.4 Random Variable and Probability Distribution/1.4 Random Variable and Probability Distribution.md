# Normal distribution
### Formula
#normal_distribution
$$
f(x)=N(x;m,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$
### Expected value:
$$
E(X)=m
$$
### Variance:
$$
D^2(X)=\sigma^2
$$
### Properties
Symmetric to the line $x=m$
Maximum equal to $\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$ at $x=m$
Inflection points on $x=m-\sigma$ and $x=m+\sigma$
The probability of some value in interval is: 
$$
P(x_1 < X < x_2) =\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\exp(-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2\sigma^2})dx
$$
Standarization:
$$
Z=\frac{X-m}{\sigma}
$$
Probability density and cumulative distribution functions of $N(x;0,1)$
$$
\phi(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2})
$$
$$
\Phi(x)=\int_{-\infty}^x \phi(t)dt
$$
# Chi squared ($\mathcal{X}^2$)
This is the sum of $k$ independent standard distributions
$$
Y=\sum_{i=1}^k U_i^2
$$
This has a chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom ($chi(k)$)
The density function is expressed as:
$$
f(x)=\frac{x^{\frac{k}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{x}{2}}}{2^{\frac{k}{2}}\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}
$$
Where $\Gamma$ is:
$$
\Gamma(p)=\int_0^{+\infty}x^{p-1}e^{-x}dx
$$
### Student distribution:
Let $U$ and $Y$ be the independent random variables with normal $N(x; 0, 1)$ and $chi(k)$ distributions, respectively. The random variable:
$$
T=\frac{U}{\sqrt{\frac{Y}{k}}}
$$
![[ChiSquare plot.png]]
has a Student’s t-distribution with k degrees of freedom. The density function of the Student’s t-distribution is expressed by the formula:
$$
f(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\sqrt{k\pi}\Gamma(\frac{k}{2})}(1+\frac{x^2}{k})^{-\frac{k+1}{2}}
$$

# F-Snedecor Distribution
Let U and V be two independent random variables with $chi(k_{nom})$ and $chi(k_{den})$ distributions, respectively. The random variable:
$$
F=\frac{U/k_{nom}}{V/k_{den}}
$$
has F-Snedecor distribution with knom and kden degrees of freedom of nominator and denominator, respectively (F in honour of English statistician R. Fisher). The sample plot of F-Snedecor’s distribution is shown in Fig. 1.11 (the complicated formula is not included).

# Exponential distribution
$$
f(x; a)=\{0 for x<0; ae^{-ax} for x \ge 0\}
$$
The expectation and variance of this distribution are defined by the formula below. The sample plot of exponential distribution is shown below.
$$
E(X)=\frac{1}{a}\space\space\space D^2(X)=\frac{1}{x^2}
$$
![[Exponential.png]]
Exponential distribution is a special case (p = 1) of gamma distribution (with scale a and shape p parameters) characterized by the following probability density function
$$
f(x;a,p)=\frac{a^p}{\Gamma(p)}x^{p-1}e^{-ax}
$$
# Continuous Uniform Distribution
One of the simplest continuous distributions in all of statistics is the continuous uniform distribution. This distribution is characterized by a density function that is “flat” and, thus, the probability is uniform in a closed interval, say $[a, b]$. The probability density function of the continuous uniform random variable X on the interval $[a, b]$ is:
$$
f(x)=\{\frac{1}{b-a}x\in[a, b]; 0 \notin [a,b]\}
$$
The cdf for the function is:
$$
F(x)=\set{0forx<a; \frac{x-a}{b-a}forx\in[a,b];1forx>b}
$$
The notation X ∼ uni f (a, b) states that a random variable X has a uniform distribution on the interval $[a, b]$. It can be shown that the expectation and variance of such random variable $X$ are:
$$
E(X)=\frac{a+b}{2}
$$
$$
D^2(X)=\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}
$$
