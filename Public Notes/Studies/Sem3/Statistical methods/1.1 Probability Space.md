Experiment describes any process that generates a set of data.
In this section, we will present a mathematical construct of probability theory, a probability space that is used as a model of a statistical experiment. We will also provide examples of probability spaces for various statistical experiments. In probability theory a probability space is a construct consisting of three elements:
$Î©$ -> a sample space
$Z$ -> a set of events
$P$ -> a probability measure on $Z$
If $k\in Z$ then $k$ is a possible result of statistical experiment, it is called a simple element or elementary event, or an outcome.
