#conditional_probability #total_probability 
In the event of having 3 boxes with some defective products, what are the probabilities that if we have a defective product we had it from a certain box?
Data:
$$ P(A_k)=\frac{1}{3} \space k=1,2,3 $$
$$ P(A|A_1) =0.01 $$$$ P(A|A_2) =0.03 $$$$ P(A|A_3) =0.1 $$
Event of getting a defective item at all is:
$$ P(A) = \frac{1}{3}\cdot 0.01 + \frac{1}{3}\cdot 0.03 + \frac{1}{3}\cdot 0.1 \approx 0.05 $$
##### This is an example of total probability
