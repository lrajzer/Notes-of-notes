## Total Probability
#total_probability
Total Probability of A space of a probability space of $(\Omega, Z, P)$ and  $A_1,\ldots,A_n \in Z$ are MECE (Mutually Exclusive Complimentary Events). For any event $A \in Z$ its probability can be computed with:
$$
 P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(A|A_i)P(A_i)
$$
The probabilities $P(A_i)$ are called priori probabilities, i.e. given in advance, while $P(A)$ is called the total probability
## Bayes Rule
#bayes_rule
Bayes rules is given by the formula:
$$
P(A_i|A)=\frac{P(A|A_i)P(A)}{\sum_{j=1}^n P(A|A_j)P(A_j)}
$$
This answers the question: What's the probability of a hypothesis $A_i$ given the observed evidence $A$.
